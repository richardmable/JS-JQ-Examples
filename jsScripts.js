//[0] will select the first array, the powder ski array.
//[2] then tell us to go to the second(/third) array inside of the powder ski array,
//which is the color array. [0] then tells us to select the first(0 index) option for the color,
//which is blue. Thus, this line should print to the console: 'blue'
